# üöÄ DetectoReal - Streamlit Cloud Deployment Guide

## ‚úÖ Problem Fixed

The original error was:
```
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'model.pth'
```

This happened because:
1. **Model files were excluded by `.gitignore`** - The `.gitignore` file was excluding all model files (`*.pth`, `*.h5`, `*.keras`)
2. **No error handling** - The app crashed immediately when the model file wasn't found
3. **Hardcoded file paths** - The code assumed the model file would always be in the same directory

## üîß Changes Made

### 1. Fixed `.gitignore` File
- **Before**: Model files were excluded from Git
- **After**: Model files are now included in the repository
- **Files affected**: `model.pth`, `real_vs_fake.keras`, `real_vs_fake.h5`

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling in `predict.py`
- Added robust model loading with multiple path detection
- Added proper error messages for debugging
- Added fallback paths for Streamlit Cloud deployment

### 3. Improved `app.py` Error Handling
- Added graceful model loading with `@st.cache_resource`
- Added user-friendly error messages
- Added deployment troubleshooting guide

### 4. Created Deployment Check Script
- `app.py` - Main Streamlit application

## üìã Files Modified

1. **`.gitignore`** - Commented out model file exclusions
2. **`predict.py`** - Added robust model loading and error handling
3. **`app.py`** - Added graceful error handling and user feedback
4. **`app.py`** - Main Streamlit application with feedback system

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Verify Files Are Present
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### 2. Commit All Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Streamlit Cloud deployment - include model files and add error handling"
git push
```

### 3. Deploy to Streamlit Cloud
1. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Set the main file path to: `app.py`
4. Deploy!

## üîç What the Fix Does

### Model Loading Strategy
The app now tries multiple paths to find the model:
- `model.pth` (current directory)
- `/mount/src/detectoreal/model.pth` (Streamlit Cloud path)
- `/app/model.pth` (alternative Streamlit Cloud path)

### Error Handling
- If model fails to load, shows helpful error message
- Provides troubleshooting steps
- Gracefully handles missing files

### User Experience
- Clear error messages instead of crashes
- Helpful deployment guide
- Verification script to check readiness

## üìä File Sizes
- `model.pth`: 8.1 MB (PyTorch model)
- `real_vs_fake.keras`: 64.5 MB (Keras model)
- `real_vs_fake.h5`: 64.5 MB (H5 model)

## ‚úÖ Expected Result
After deployment, your Streamlit app should:
1. Load without FileNotFoundError
2. Display the DetectoReal interface
3. Allow image uploads
4. Successfully predict real vs fake images

## üÜò Troubleshooting

If you still get errors:

1. **Check file sizes**: Ensure model files are under Streamlit Cloud limits
2. **Verify repository**: Make sure all files are committed and pushed
3. **Check logs**: Look at Streamlit Cloud logs for detailed error messages
4. **Test locally**: Run `streamlit run app.py` locally first

## üìû Support
If you continue to have issues:
1. Check the Streamlit Cloud logs
2. Verify all files are in your repository
3. Ensure the model files are not corrupted
4. Try running the app locally: `streamlit run app.py`
