# 🧠 Enhanced RLHF Image Classifier

A real-time learning image classification system that can distinguish between real and AI-generated images, with the ability to learn from user feedback and persist learning across sessions.

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Original Issue**: The model's learning from user feedback was not persisting after page refresh. When an AI-generated image was incorrectly predicted as "real" and corrected by the user, the model would learn and predict correctly. However, upon refreshing the page, the model would revert to its original state and make the same incorrect prediction.

**Solution**: Implemented a comprehensive dual-persistence system with enhanced learning capabilities.

## ✅ Enhanced Features

### 1. **Dual Persistence System**
- **Session State**: For immediate persistence during the current session
- **File Storage**: For cross-session persistence across page refreshes

### 2. **Comprehensive Data Augmentation**
- **Random Crop**: Multiple crop scales (compress/expand)
- **Flip Transforms**: Horizontal and vertical flips
- **Rotation**: Various rotation angles (5-60 degrees)
- **Color Transforms**: Brightness, contrast, saturation, hue adjustments
- **Perspective Transforms**: Random perspective distortion
- **Affine Transforms**: Translation, scaling, and rotation combinations
- **Grayscale**: Random grayscale conversion

### 3. **Enhanced Fine-tuning**
- **10-20 Epochs**: Ensures robust learning on new examples (not from scratch)
- **L2 Regularization**: Prevents overfitting
- **Focal Loss**: Better learning of hard examples
- **Gradient Clipping**: Stable training
- **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time epoch and loss tracking

### 4. **Persistent Files Created**
- `learned_model.pth` - The improved model weights
- `vector_db.pkl` - Vector database for similar image matching
- `feedback_dataset.pkl` - Feedback dataset for fine-tuning

### 5. **Enhanced Loading Logic**
- **Priority 1**: Load learned model from `learned_model.pth` if it exists
- **Priority 2**: Fall back to original model from `model.pth`
- **Priority 3**: Initialize new model if no files exist

## 🚀 How It Works

### Learning Process
1. **User Upload**: User uploads an image for classification
2. **Initial Prediction**: Model makes initial prediction
3. **User Feedback**: User corrects the prediction if wrong
4. **Immediate Learning**: Model learns from feedback with augmentations
5. **Fine-tuning**: Model fine-tunes for 10-20 epochs on new data
6. **Persistence**: Learning is saved to both session state and files
7. **Verification**: Model is tested on the same image to verify learning

### Persistence Mechanism
```python
# Session State (immediate)
st.session_state.model_state = model.state_dict()

# File Storage (cross-session)
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'learned_model.pth')
pickle.dump(vector_db, 'vector_db.pkl')
pickle.dump(feedback_dataset, 'feedback_dataset.pkl')
```

### Augmentation Pipeline
```python
aug_transforms = [
    transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(p=1.0),
    transforms.RandomVerticalFlip(p=0.5),
    transforms.RandomRotation(degrees=15),
    transforms.ColorJitter(brightness=0.2, contrast=0.2, saturation=0.2, hue=0.1),
    transforms.RandomGrayscale(p=0.1),
    transforms.RandomResizedCrop(size=(128, 128), scale=(0.7, 1.0)),  # Compress
    transforms.RandomResizedCrop(size=(128, 128), scale=(0.9, 1.2)),  # Expand
    transforms.RandomCrop(size=(128, 128), padding=10),
    transforms.RandomAffine(degrees=10, translate=(0.1, 0.1), scale=(0.8, 1.2)),
    transforms.RandomPerspective(distortion_scale=0.2, p=0.5),
]
```
