## üîß How It Works

### 1. **Initial Prediction**
```python
# User uploads image
result = rtl.predict_with_learning(image)
prediction = result["prediction"]  # "fake" or "real"
confidence = result["confidence"]  # 0.0 to 1.0
```

### 2. **User Provides Feedback**
```python
# User clicks "Incorrect" and provides correction
result = rtl.predict_with_learning(
    image=image,
    user_feedback="This is wrong",
    user_correction="fake"  # or "real"
)
```

### 3. **Immediate Learning**
- Model weights updated instantly using gradient descent
- Image features extracted and stored in memory
- Model saved with improvements
- Same image will now predict correctly

### 4. **Memory Recognition**
- Exact same image uses memory prediction
- Similar images use feature-based matching
- Consistent predictions across sessions

## üîç Technical Implementation

### Real-Time Learning Algorithm:
```python
def _immediate_learn(self, image, model_prediction, user_correction, confidence):
    # 1. Prepare training data
    image_tensor = transform(image).unsqueeze(0).to(device)
    target = torch.tensor([0 if user_correction == 'fake' else 1])
    
    # 2. Calculate loss
    self.model.train()
    output = self.model(image_tensor)
    loss = F.cross_entropy(output, target)
    
    # 3. Add confidence penalty
    if confidence > 0.7:
        loss *= 1.5
    
    # 4. Update weights
    loss.backward()
    self.optimizer.step()
    
    # 5. Save improved model
    torch.save(self.model.state_dict(), 'model.pth')
```

### Memory System:
```python
def add_image(self, image_hash, prediction, confidence, timestamp):
    memory_entry = {
        'image_hash': image_hash,
        'prediction': prediction,
        'confidence': confidence,
        'timestamp': timestamp
    }
    self.images.append(memory_entry)
    self.image_dict[image_hash] = memory_entry
```
